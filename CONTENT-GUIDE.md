## Tips & Best Practices

### File Naming
✅ **DO:**
- `2024-11-15-seed-funding-announcement.md`
- `2024-12-01-baker-construction-update.md`
- `ev-charging-infrastructure-study.md`

❌ **DON'T:**
- `Press Release Nov 15.md` (no spaces, no generic names)
- `Announcement.md` (not descriptive enough)
- `11-15-2024-news.md` (wrong date format)

### SEO Descriptions
- Keep under 160 characters
- Include key terms naturally
- Make it compelling (this shows in search results and social shares)

### Dates
- Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` format for press releases and blog posts
- Case studies don't require dates in filenames

### Testing Before Publishing
```bash
# Run Jekyll locally to preview
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit http://localhost:4000
# Check that everything looks right
# Then commit and push
```

### Commit Messages
Write clear commit messages:
- ✅ "Add press release about Series A funding"
- ✅ "Update Baker Basecamp construction timeline"
- ✅ "Fix typo in November blog post"
- ❌ "Update" (too vague)
- ❌ "Changes" (not helpful)

### Content Guidelines
- **Press Releases:** Formal, factual, include boilerplate at end
- **Blog Posts:** Conversational, storytelling, educational
- **Case Studies:** Data-driven, problem/solution/results format

### When Content Goes Live
- Changes typically deploy in **1-2 minutes** after pushing to GitHub
- Check the "Actions" tab on GitHub to see build status
- Green checkmark = successfully deployed
- Red X = build failed (check error messages)

---

## Example Files

Check these files in the repo for reference:

### Press Release Example
`_press_releases/2024-11-02-baker-basecamp-announcement.md`

### Blog Post Example
