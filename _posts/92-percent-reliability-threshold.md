The EV charging industry has reached a pivotal milestone: a **92.3% reliability score** across the U.S. fast-charging network as of Q3 2025, according to Paren's latest State of the Industry Report. This represents meaningful progress—reliability improved from 92.1% in Q2 2025, driven by new station deployments, retirement of poorly maintained legacy sites, and ongoing station refreshes.

But here's the sobering reality: **1 in 13 charging attempts still fails.** For the millions of EV drivers who depend on public charging infrastructure, that 7.7% failure rate remains the #1 pain point preventing widespread EV adoption.

At Rangeway Energy, we believe understanding this threshold—and the software-driven solutions closing the gap—is critical to building the reliable charging network America needs.

## The State of Reliability: Progress and Persistent Challenges

### By the Numbers

The Q3 2025 data paints a picture of an industry making steady but uneven progress:

- **64,486 total ports** across 12,375 stations nationwide
- **32 states improved** reliability scores; 15 declined; 4 remained unchanged
- **State variation is dramatic**: Top performers exceed 95% reliability, while Oklahoma languishes at 73.3% (though it showed the strongest improvement at +4.4%)
- **Major markets** showed mixed results: Nevada (95.4%, -0.2), California (92.6%, -0.5), Texas (92.5%, +1.0), New Jersey (92.6%, -0.2)

This variability underscores a crucial insight: **reliability is less about geography and more about operator performance, site age, and proactive maintenance.**

### What "First Charge Success Rate" Really Means

The industry has coalesced around "first charge success rate" as the critical metric—measuring whether a driver can successfully charge on the first attempt. This metric matters because it captures the real-world experience: a driver pulls up, plugs in, and either charges successfully or faces frustration.

Federal programs like NEVI have established uptime expectations as standards, but as ChargerHelp's recent report emphasizes, **true reliability requires moving beyond basic uptime metrics to user-centered performance.**

## Challenge: Why Do 1 in 13 Charging Attempts Fail?

The gap between 92.3% and true reliability stems from systemic challenges across hardware, software, and operations:

### Key Issues

**1. Interoperability Failures**

Many vendors claim to be "OCPP-capable," but this vague terminology masks significant interoperability issues. Hardware and software providers often implement the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) differently, creating hidden failure points that only surface after deployment.

**2. Poorly Managed Firmware Updates**

Firmware updates are a common cause of station failures. Updates often introduce new problems when they're not adequately tested or when stakeholders are left unaware of their arrival.

**3. Inconsistent Error Reporting**

Current error reporting across the industry is inconsistent and often unhelpful. Many error codes return vague categories like "Other" or don't correlate to specific actions, causing delays in diagnosis and extended downtime.

**4. Limited Backend Access**

When maintenance teams can't access error codes, system status, and key logs, troubleshooting becomes slower and less scalable.

## Solution: Software-Driven Approaches to 99% Reliability

The most promising path forward doesn't require reinventing hardware—it requires smarter software and operational practices.

### Implementation: Key Technologies

**Predictive Maintenance**

Rather than waiting for chargers to fail, predictive maintenance uses data analytics to identify potential issues before they cause downtime. By monitoring patterns in charging sessions, error logs, and environmental factors, operators can schedule proactive repairs during low-demand periods.

**Remote Diagnostics**

Many station issues can be diagnosed and even resolved remotely—if operators have proper backend access. Remote diagnostics eliminate the need for costly truck rolls for minor issues like software glitches or configuration errors.

**Standardized Protocols and Certification**

The foundation of reliability is standardization:

- **OCPP 2.0.1 certification** for true interoperability from the Open Charge Alliance (OCA)
- **ISO 15118 compatibility** for Plug&Charge functionality
- **OCPI/OICP compatibility** for open roaming across networks
- **MRECS (Minimum Required Error Codes)** developed by the ChargeX Consortium for actionable troubleshooting

**Transparent Firmware Management**

Using the OCA Vendor Declaration tool for every firmware update, with notifications from both hardware manufacturers and software providers, ensuring visibility into firmware versions for troubleshooting.

**Backend Access Requirements**

Hardware OEMs must grant backend access to reliability partners, ensuring operational independence even if the original company exits the market.

**Performance-Based O&M Contracts**

Moving from hourly labor costs to fixed monthly fees with unlimited labor ensures vendor investment in reducing service calls and maintaining uptime.

## Results: The Rangeway Energy Approach

At Rangeway Energy, we're designing our charging infrastructure with these software-driven solutions at the core:

### Key Metrics and Commitments

- ✅ **OCPP 2.0.1 certified** hardware and software with verified OCA certification
- ✅ **ISO 15118 Plug&Charge** compatibility for frictionless user experiences
- ✅ **Open roaming protocols** (OCPI/OICP) to eliminate walled gardens
- ✅ **Predictive maintenance platforms** to prevent failures before they happen
- ✅ **Standardized error reporting** (MRECS) for rapid troubleshooting
- ✅ **Performance-based O&M contracts** that align vendor incentives with uptime

We believe that achieving 99%+ reliability isn't just possible—it's essential for EV adoption at scale.

### Impact on the Industry

The industry's journey from 92.3% to true reliability requires:

1. **Procurement standards that demand accountability** - Moving beyond "OCPP-capable" claims to require actual certification
2. **Transparent firmware management** - Proactive notifications and version visibility
3. **Meaningful error reporting** - Implementing MRECS across all stations
4. **Aligned O&M incentives** - Contracts that reward uptime, not truck rolls
5. **Right to repair protections** - Ensuring parts availability and third-party support even as manufacturers consolidate

## Conclusion

As Paren's Q3 report notes:

> "Maintenance is becoming increasingly more strategic. As more federally and state-funded chargers go live, the challenge is no longer just buildout but upkeep. Operators that invest in preventive maintenance, faster outage response, and software integration will be best positioned to maintain user trust as utilization continues to rise."

Charging reliability is more than a technical metric—it's the foundation of EV driver confidence. Every failed charging attempt erodes trust in electric vehicles and slows the transition to sustainable transportation.

But the solutions exist. Software-driven approaches—predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, standardized protocols, and performance-based contracts—can deliver the 99%+ reliability that EV drivers deserve.

At Rangeway Energy, we're committed to building that future. Because when charging just works, electric vehicles become the obvious choice.
