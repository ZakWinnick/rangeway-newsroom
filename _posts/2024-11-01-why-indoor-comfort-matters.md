If you've ever charged an EV on a road trip, you know the experience: pull into a parking lot, plug in your car, and then... what? Sit in your vehicle for 20-30 minutes? Stand outside in whatever weather nature has decided to throw at you that day?

This is the experience we're changing at Rangeway Energy.

## The Parking Lot Problem

Traditional EV charging infrastructure treats vehicles as the customer. But people are the actual customers. And people need:

- **Climate control** - Not 95°F desert heat or 30°F mountain cold
- **Comfortable seating** - Not a car seat or a concrete curb
- **Quality food and coffee** - Not vending machines
- **Clean restrooms** - Maintained to hospitality standards
- **Reliable WiFi** - To stay productive or entertained

## Why This Matters for Scenic Routes

The infrastructure gap is particularly acute on scenic corridors. According to a 2024 AAA survey, 55% of EV drivers avoid scenic routes due to charging anxiety. That's not just about range—it's about the experience.

When you're exploring Death Valley, the Pacific Coast Highway, or Colorado's mountain passes, you're seeking adventure and beauty. Your charging stop shouldn't feel like a chore to endure. It should be a welcome break—a chance to stretch, refuel yourself while your vehicle recharges, and prepare for the next leg of your journey.

## Building for People

At Rangeway, every location—from our flagship Baker Basecamp to our regional Waystations—guarantees climate-controlled indoor comfort. It's not a nice-to-have. It's table stakes.

We're building the infrastructure that scenic routes deserve. Infrastructure designed for the way people actually want to travel.

## What's Next

Baker Basecamp opens in 2026, followed by regional Waystations throughout the Southwest. We're starting with the LA-Vegas corridor and Death Valley, but this is just the beginning.

The future of EV travel shouldn't mean compromising on comfort. And with Rangeway, it won't.
