## Executive Summary

Since opening on September 15, 2024, Baker Basecamp has served as both our flagship charging location and a real-world laboratory for understanding EV traveler needs on scenic routes. This case study examines the first 30 days of operation, analyzing charging patterns, dwell times, and customer feedback to validate our core thesis: that combining ultra-fast charging with hospitality-focused amenities creates a superior EV travel experience.

## Key Findings

### Charging Session Data
- **1,247 total charging sessions** completed
- **Average session duration**: 23 minutes
- **Peak utilization**: Saturdays 10am-2pm (92% average utilization)
- **Average energy delivered**: 47.3 kWh per session
- **Power delivery**: 87% of sessions utilized 250kW+ charging speeds

### Customer Demographics
- **68% leisure travelers** (vs. 32% local/commuter traffic)
- **Primary routes**: LA-Vegas (41%), San Diego-Vegas (28%), Phoenix-LA (19%)
- **Vehicle mix**: Tesla (52%), Rivian (18%), Other EVs (30%)

### Dwell Time Analysis
The data revealed a surprising pattern: customers stayed an average of **38 minutes** despite charging sessions averaging only 23 minutes. This 15-minute "bonus dwell time" correlates strongly with amenity usage:

- **72% of customers** entered the climate-controlled lounge
- **61%** purchased food or beverages
- **43%** used restroom facilities
- **28%** worked remotely using provided WiFi

## The Indoor Comfort Factor

Perhaps the most significant finding was the impact of our climate-controlled lounge. During the study period, Baker experienced typical desert conditions with afternoon temperatures averaging 94°F. Customer surveys revealed:

- **89% of respondents** cited indoor comfort as "very important" to their experience
- **76%** said they would choose Rangeway over competitors specifically because of the lounge
- **Customer satisfaction scores**: 4.7/5.0 average (vs. industry average of 3.2/5.0 for DC fast charging)

One customer comment captured the sentiment: *"Finally, a charging station that treats us like guests, not just cars that need electrons."*

## Route Pattern Insights

### LA-Vegas Corridor (41% of traffic)
- Most popular departure window: Friday 4pm-8pm
- Average arrival SOC: 28%
- Average departure SOC: 87%
- **Strategic insight**: Travelers prefer to charge near the halfway point, aligning perfectly with Baker's location

### Weekend vs. Weekday Patterns
Weekend traffic showed distinctly different behavior:
- **Weekend**: Longer dwell times (42 min avg), higher food purchases, more lounge usage
- **Weekday**: Shorter stays (31 min avg), higher percentage of "just charging" sessions
- **Implication**: Leisure travelers value amenities more than commuters, validating our scenic route focus

## Revenue Analysis

While still early, the data suggests promising unit economics:

- **Charging revenue**: $41,200 (avg $0.49/kWh)
- **Retail revenue**: $18,700 (avg $15/customer who entered lounge)
- **Blended revenue per session**: $48
- **Total revenue**: $59,900 for 30 days

The 31% ancillary revenue (retail/food) significantly exceeds industry benchmarks of 12-15%, suggesting our hospitality model creates additional revenue streams beyond electrons.

## Customer Feedback Themes

### Top Positive Comments
1. "Clean, comfortable lounge made the stop enjoyable"
2. "Fast charging + good coffee = perfect road trip break"
3. "Finally feeling like a valued customer, not just a car"
4. "Kids loved having a real place to stretch during the charge"

### Areas for Improvement
1. More food options (noted by 34% of survey respondents)
2. Outdoor seating area for mild weather days
3. More phone charging outlets in lounge
4. Extended hours (currently 6am-10pm)

## Strategic Implications

### What This Means for Network Expansion

The Baker data validates several key assumptions:

1. **Location matters**: Placement on scenic routes attracts high-value leisure travelers
2. **Amenities drive loyalty**: Indoor comfort is a key differentiator, not a nice-to-have
3. **Dwell time = revenue**: Longer stays driven by amenities create ancillary revenue opportunities
4. **Scalability**: High customer satisfaction suggests the model can be replicated

### Learnings for Future Locations

Based on Baker's performance, future Waystations should prioritize:
- Larger lounge spaces (current 800 sq ft feels constrained at peak times)
- Enhanced food/beverage offerings
- Strategic placement at 120-150 mile intervals on scenic routes
- Design for "Instagram moments" (social media mentions exceeded expectations)

## Looking Ahead

The first 30 days at Baker Basecamp exceeded our internal projections by 18% for charging sessions and 34% for ancillary revenue. More importantly, the data confirms that EV travelers on scenic routes value comfort and hospitality alongside fast charging.

As we prepare to open our next Waystations in Alamo, NV and Kingman, AZ, the Baker learnings will inform design decisions, operational procedures, and service offerings. The goal remains the same: make EV road trips to America's scenic destinations not just possible, but preferable.
