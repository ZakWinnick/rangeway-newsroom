**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - October 29, 2025** - Rangeway Energy, the hospitality-driven EV charging network for America's scenic corridors, today announced the appointment of Theo Reichgelt as Fractional Chief Marketing Officer.

The appointment comes as Rangeway prepares to launch its first Basecamp location in Baker, California, and advance its Pre-Seed funding round. Reichgelt will lead brand development, market positioning, and go-to-market strategy as the company scales its hub-satellite network across scenic routes throughout the western United States.

"We're not just building charging infrastructure—we're building destinations," said Zak Winnick, Founder and CEO of Rangeway Energy. "Theo's experience developing retail-driven charging brands in Europe is exactly what we need as we introduce American drivers to a new kind of EV travel experience."

## Retail-Driven Charging for Scenic Routes

Rangeway differentiates itself through a hospitality-first approach that transforms necessary charging stops into memorable travel experiences. Every location features climate-controlled indoor lounges, café-quality food and beverage, and partnerships with local retailers—amenities designed to make EV road trips through scenic corridors feel natural and effortless.

The company's hub-satellite model pairs regional Basecamp hubs (6-8 DC fast chargers, full-service café, network operations center) with unmanned Waystation satellites (4 chargers, automated retail, indoor lounges) to deliver reliable coverage across routes that national charging networks cannot economically serve.

## European Experience Meets American Corridors

Reichgelt founded Nexxt Industry to support charge point operators entering and scaling within European markets. His work includes brand development, product positioning, and market entry strategy for eMobility companies navigating diverse regulatory environments and consumer expectations across the continent.

This collaboration marks Nexxt Industry's first US market engagement, bringing proven frameworks for retail-integrated charging experiences to Rangeway's California launch and planned expansion into Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and the Pacific Northwest.

Rangeway's Phase 1 deployment focuses on the California desert corridor, with the Baker Basecamp serving as both a flagship location and proof of concept for the company's hospitality-driven model. The site will demonstrate indoor comfort guarantees, hub-satellite operational reliability, and member rate predictability through the company's Pathfinder Rewards loyalty program.

## About Rangeway Energy

Rangeway Energy is building America's premier electric vehicle charging network for scenic corridors. Every Rangeway location features climate-controlled indoor lounges, premium cafés, and ultra-fast charging infrastructure—eliminating the parking lot waits that plague traditional EV charging.
