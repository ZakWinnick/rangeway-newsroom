**BAKER, Calif., November 19, 2025** — Rangeway Energy, Inc., a premium EV charging network redefining what it means to charge on America's scenic highways, today announced it has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire 72074 Baker Boulevard in Baker, California. The 2.34-acre property will become the company's flagship Baker Basecamp, serving travelers along one of the West's most iconic routes.

Baker sits at the crossroads of adventure. More than five million trips pass through the I-15 corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas each year, and 1.1 million visitors make their way to nearby Death Valley National Park. Yet for EV drivers, this landscape of stunning vistas and open roads has too often meant unreliable charging and uncomfortable waits.

"Baker is where it all begins for us. This corridor connects two of the West's most traveled routes, and it's a perfect example of where EV charging should be exceptional but too often falls short," said Zak Winnick, founder and CEO. "Signing this LOI means we can finally start building the kind of charging experience that matches the landscape around it."

Rangeway is changing that equation. The Baker Basecamp will transform the existing property into a welcoming destination featuring six dual port, ultra-fast DC fast chargers, a full-service café, and a climate-controlled Driver's Lounge where travelers can relax in comfort while their vehicles charge. Every detail is designed with the road-tripper in mind, from premium restrooms to thoughtful amenities that make the stop worth the time.

Baker will also anchor a network of smaller Waystations throughout the region, bringing the same commitment to hospitality and reliability to communities across the Southwest. The approach is simple: treat charging infrastructure the way great hotels treat their properties, with on-site care, quality standards, and genuine attention to the guest experience.

Baker represents Rangeway's initial entry into the Southwest market. The company has identified expansion opportunities in Colorado, Utah, and the Pacific Northwest, with plans to develop additional locations over the next five years.
